- 👋 Hi, I’m @hockeyrick93
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things but have a problem now which guided me here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me -hockeyrick@hotmail.com, and whatsapp, BELOW is my problem with Facebook, can anyone help me? Was hoping to contact Matt
After system restore, can't in any way, shape or form login to my Facebook. How can I actually contact FB Support of something similar? I have no other alternatives. Login does not recognize ANY of the passwords I have used AND the 6 digit code is NEVER sent to email or phone-don't know why, so cannot change password. I need help. Can you?
Can anyone help me? This is beyond my scope.
